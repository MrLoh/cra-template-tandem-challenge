# Tandem Code Challenge Create React App Template

This is a Create React App template for the Tandem code challenge. It was bootstrapped from the official [TypeScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and amended with a mock API to use.

To use this template, run `npx create-react-app my-app --template tandem-challenge`
